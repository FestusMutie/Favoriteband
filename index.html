        <h2>About Maroon 5 band</h2>
        <p>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California,USA. It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar.I love this band because they have songs for every type of relationship-I listen to "Moves like a jagger" when i am going out to have a good time,"sugar" when I am in love head over heels,"This love" when am going through a bad break up.Basically,their music is unstoppably catchy,and the whole band has an irresistable appeal and charisma that fans cant get enough of.</p>
